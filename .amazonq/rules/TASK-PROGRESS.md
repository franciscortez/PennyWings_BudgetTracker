### UI Refinements & Layout Optimization - 2026-03-21

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Addressed mobile usability issues by fixing overlapping text in the bottom navigation bar (truncation and responsive scaling) and improving the responsiveness of the `Target Date` input in the `GoalForm`. Standardized the dashboard status cards to show real-time average progress for budgets and goals using live data hooks.

**Files Modified/Created:**

- `src/components/Layout.jsx` (Responsive navigation and icon size tweaks)
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` (Integrated `useGoals` and `useBudgetStats` for real-time progress)
- `src/components/goals/GoalForm.jsx` (Target Date input refinement)
- `src/pages/Monitoring.jsx` (Reordered tabs to show Goals first by default)

**Outcome:**

- A more professional and stable mobile UI with no overlapping text.
- Dashboard stats provide immediate, accurate feedback on financial progress.

### Automated Goal Tracking via Linked Accounts - 2026-03-21

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Implemented Goal automation by linking goals directly to Accounts (Bank Cards or E-Wallets). When an account is linked, the Goal's `current_amount` dynamically mirrors the live balance of the linked account. This allows the new `Transfer` feature to seamlessly update Goal progress automatically without manual ledgers.

**Files Modified/Created:**

- `Supabase SQL` (Added `linked_card_id` and `linked_wallet_id` to `goals` table)
- `src/components/goals/GoalForm.jsx` (Redesigned with Linking options)
- `src/hooks/useGoals.js` (Dynamically maps live card/wallet balances into goals)
- `src/components/goals/GoalItem.jsx` (Added visual "Linked" badge)

**Outcome:**

- Infinite flexibility for goal savings without disjointed data.
- Removes manual data entry requirements for goal contributions.

### Monitoring Form Backdrop Blur Fix - 2026-03-21

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Fixed a CSS context issue in `Monitoring.jsx` where the background blur for `BudgetForm` and `GoalForm` did not cover the entire viewport. The forms were previously nested inside `AnimatedPage`, which created a new CSS stacking context via `transform`, trapping the `fixed` positioning. Moving the modals to sit directly inside `<Layout>` resolved the issue, making the overlay accurately match `TransactionForm.jsx`.

**Files Modified/Created:**

- `src/pages/Monitoring.jsx` (Extracted forms from transformed wrapper)

**Outcome:**

- Form background blurs now correctly cover the whole screen.
- Enhanced aesthetic consistency across all application modals.

---

### Transfer Feature Implementation - 2026-03-19

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Implemented a robust "Transfer" feature allowing users to move funds between accounts (Bank Cards and E-Wallets). This involved a database schema update to support destination accounts, atomic balance management in the `useTransactions` hook (deducting from source, adding to destination), and a redesigned `TransactionForm` with a 2x2 type grid and conditional destination fields.

**Files Modified/Created:**

- `src/hooks/useTransactions.js` (Implemented transfer logic in add/delete/update mutations)
- `src/components/transactions/TransactionForm.jsx` (Redesigned with 2x2 grid and transfer support)
- `src/pages/Transactions.jsx` (Added transfer filter and styled table rows)
- `src/hooks/useDashboardData.js` (Include transfer info in recent activity)
- `src/pages/Dashboard.jsx` (Display account-to-account moves in activity list)

**Outcome:**

- Users can now perform account-to-account transfers with blue-coded UI highlights.
- Balance integrity is maintained across both source and destination accounts.
- Transaction history clearly visualizes internal fund movements.

---

### Cash Deposits & Transfer UI Unlocked - 2026-03-19

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Enabled "Cash to Card" (Deposits) and "Card to Cash" (Withdrawals) uniformly by unlocking `Cash` as a fully valid `payment_method` in both the Source and Destination dropdowns within the `TransactionForm`. This prevents internal money movements from artificially inflating Income or Expense reports.

**Files Modified/Created:**

- `src/components/transactions/TransactionForm.jsx` (Removed cash UI restrictions, mapped destination `cashWallet.id` payload)
- `src/hooks/useTransactions.js` (Reviewed update mutation recovery logic, confirmed mathematical soundness for reverts)

**Outcome:**

- Users can natively use the "Transfer" tab to deposit cash to a bank card or move e-wallet funds to physical cash.
- Reporting numbers remain perfectly accurate because transfers do not trigger `income` or `expense` aggregations.

---

### Monitoring Module & Responsive Forms Optimization - 2026-03-21

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Combined the Budgets and Goals functionality into a unified `Monitoring.jsx` page with a tabbed interface. Standardized the responsive form design for `BudgetForm.jsx` and `GoalForm.jsx` to match the premium styling of `TransactionForm.jsx` (utilizing correct z-indices, scrolling behavior, and modal scales). Updated delete actions to use the centralized `getConfirm` preset utility.

**Files Modified/Created:**

- `src/pages/Monitoring.jsx` (New unified view)
- `src/components/budgets/BudgetForm.jsx` (Responsive redesign)
- `src/components/goals/GoalForm.jsx` (Responsive redesign)
- `src/components/budgets/BudgetItem.jsx` (Mobile UI)
- `src/components/goals/GoalItem.jsx` (Mobile UI)

**Outcome:**

- Users can switch between Budgets and Goals in one centralized tracking hub.
- All forms behave perfectly on mobile with internal scrolling and proper overlay dismissals.
- Delete confirmations share consistent theming and text defaults via `confirmPresets`.

---

### Pagination Error Handling & Safety Checks - 2026-03-19

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Implemented a robust pagination safety check in `Transactions.jsx`. The system now automatically detects if a user is on an empty page (due to manual URL entry or data deletion) and silently redirects them to the nearest valid page. This prevents "No entries found" states when data exists on other pages.

**Files Modified/Created:**

- `src/pages/Transactions.jsx` (Added redirection logic and memoized handlers)

**Outcome:**

- Users requesting out-of-bounds pages (e.g., `?page=99`) are automatically redirected to `totalPages`.
- Deleting the last item on a page now correctly transitions the user to the previous page.
- URL state remains synchronized with valid server data.

### Premium Design Restoration & Framer Motion Integration - 2026-03-19

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Restored original premium design elements (pink gradients, decorative blur spots, overlays) that were lost during earlier refactoring. Integrated Framer Motion across all pages and components for smooth transitions and interactive micro-animations. Standardized the `Motion` alias for `motion/react` to resolve linting conflicts.

### Infrastructure: React Query Integration - 2026-03-18

**Status:** ✅ Completed

**Description:**
Integrated TanStack Query (React Query) v5 to manage asynchronous server state. Refactored all data-fetching hooks to use `useQuery` and `useMutation`, significantly improving caching, background synchronization, and UI responsiveness.

**Files Modified/Created:**

## 🚧 Known Issues & Blockers

**No known issues or blockers at this time**

## 📌 Important Decisions & Assumptions

### Assumptions

- Users will primarily access the app via web browser
- Free tier Supabase limits are sufficient for MVP (500MB DB, 1GB storage)
- Single currency support initially (can be extended later)
- Monthly budget cycles (not custom date ranges initially)
- Users will manually input transactions (no bank API integration in MVP)
- Each transaction can be linked to one bank card OR one e-wallet OR cash (mutually exclusive)

### Technical Decisions

- Using Context API for state management (no Redux/Zustand needed initially)
- React Router v6 for navigation
- Chart library: Chart.js or Recharts (to be decided in Phase 8)
- Date handling: date-fns for formatting and manipulation
- Form validation: Custom hooks or React Hook Form
- Real-time updates: Supabase real-time subscriptions

### Design Decisions

- **Primary Theme**: Light pink aesthetic throughout
- **Color Palette**:
  - Base: #FFC0CB (pink), #FFB6C1 (light pink), #FFF0F5 (lavender blush)
  - Accent: Deeper rose/pink for CTAs
  - Text: Dark gray/charcoal for readability
  - Cards: White or very light pink with subtle shadows
- **Dark Mode**: Muted pink/mauve tones with dark backgrounds
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Card-based UI for bank cards (swipeable on mobile)
- Minimal, clean UI focused on usability
- Color-coded categories for visual clarity
- Progress bars with green (under budget) and red (over budget) indicators

### Database Design Decisions

- Bank cards have optional credit_limit (only for credit cards)
- E-wallets have wallet_type for categorization (PayPal, GCash, Venmo, etc.)
- Transactions can exist without a linked card or wallet (cash transactions)
- Transactions have payment_method field: "cash", "card", or "ewallet"
- Only one of card_id or wallet_id can be set per transaction (mutually exclusive)
- Categories can be user-created or default system categories
- Soft delete for cards and wallets (is_active flag) to preserve transaction history
- Balance stored on both card and wallet records and updated via transactions
- RLS policies ensure users only see their own data
