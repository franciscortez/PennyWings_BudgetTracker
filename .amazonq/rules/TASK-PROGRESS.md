## 🚧 Known Issues & Blockers

**No known issues or blockers at this time**

---

## 📌 Important Decisions & Assumptions

### Assumptions

- Users will primarily access the app via web browser
- Free tier Supabase limits are sufficient for MVP (500MB DB, 1GB storage)
- Single currency support initially (can be extended later)
- Monthly budget cycles (not custom date ranges initially)
- Users will manually input transactions (no bank API integration in MVP)
- Each transaction can be linked to one bank card OR one e-wallet OR cash (mutually exclusive)

### Technical Decisions

- Using Context API for state management (no Redux/Zustand needed initially)
- React Router v6 for navigation
- Chart library: Chart.js or Recharts (to be decided in Phase 8)
- Date handling: date-fns for formatting and manipulation
- Form validation: Custom hooks or React Hook Form
- File uploads: Supabase Storage for receipts
- Real-time updates: Supabase real-time subscriptions

### Design Decisions

- **Primary Theme**: Light pink aesthetic throughout
- **Color Palette**:
  - Base: #FFC0CB (pink), #FFB6C1 (light pink), #FFF0F5 (lavender blush)
  - Accent: Deeper rose/pink for CTAs
  - Text: Dark gray/charcoal for readability
  - Cards: White or very light pink with subtle shadows
- **Dark Mode**: Muted pink/mauve tones with dark backgrounds
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Card-based UI for bank cards (swipeable on mobile)
- Minimal, clean UI focused on usability
- Color-coded categories for visual clarity
- Progress bars with green (under budget) and red (over budget) indicators

### Database Design Decisions

- Bank cards have optional credit_limit (only for credit cards)
- E-wallets have wallet_type for categorization (PayPal, GCash, Venmo, etc.)
- Transactions can exist without a linked card or wallet (cash transactions)
- Transactions have payment_method field: "cash", "card", or "ewallet"
- Only one of card_id or wallet_id can be set per transaction (mutually exclusive)
- Categories can be user-created or default system categories
- Soft delete for cards and wallets (is_active flag) to preserve transaction history
- Balance stored on both card and wallet records and updated via transactions
- RLS policies ensure users only see their own data
